CodeClan Week 4/5. Solo project.

Guidelines:

Travel Bucket List
Build an app to track someoneâ€™s travel adventures.

MVP:
The app should allow the user to track countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited.
The user should be able to create and edit countries.
Each country should have one or more cities to visit.
The user should be able to create and delete entries for cities.
The app should allow the user to mark destinations as visited or still to see.

Possible Extensions:
Have separate pages for destinations visited and those still to visit.
Add sights to the destination cities.
Search for destination by continent, city or country.
Any other ideas you might come up with.

Francesca's notes

* Features that I was hoping to look at

1. Continent views and searches (I have the model, I didn't have time for the views)

2. Long text box for notes about the trip

3. Making a model also for location type like sight type

4. Date visited (to - from?) and search by date

5. Maybe separate pages for visited and not visited (currently possible as a search result so it's just a matter of creating some views)

* Things to fix or improve

1. Make query strings safe for sql

2. More validation (but could be done with JS)

3. Trying to avoid duplicate entries

4. Different ways of sorting values in table by clicking on the th (JS)

* In my next life

1. Image upload (JS?)

2. Integrating with a map (JS)

3. Accounts for users and ability to follow friends, exchange messages, meet people in location we plan to visit
